RTEMS uses FreeBSD as the source of its TCP/IP and USB stacks.
This is a developers guide which captures information on the
process of merging code from FreeBSD, building this library,
RTEMS specific support files, and general guidelines on what
modifications to the FreeBSD source are permitted.

Goals of this effort are:

* Update TCP/IP and provide USB in RTEMS
* Ease updating to future FreeBSD versions
* Ease tracking changes in FreeBSD code
* Minimize manual changes in FreeBSD code
* Define stable kernel/device driver API which is implemented
by both RTEMS and FreeBSD. This is the foundation of the port.

We will work to push our changes upstream to the FreeBSD Project
and minimize changes required at each update point.

This is a work in progress and is very likely to be incomplete.

== Source Code Version Information

* FreeBSD 8.2 SVN r222496
* RTEMS 4.11
  - BSP must have support for all new BSD sys sections
  - It is preferable if the BSP uses linkcmds.base.
  - BSP must be from an architecture with Programmable Interrupt Controller
    interrupt model.

The FreeBSD 8.2 SVN checkout will generally be referred to as the
FreeBSD source in this document.

== To Do
* Adapt generic IRQ PIC interface code to Simple Vectored Interrupt Model
  so that those architectures can use new TCP/IP and USB code. 
* in_cksum implementations for architectures not supported by FreeBSD.
  This will require figuring out where to put implementations that do
  not originate from FreeBSD and are populated via the script.
* generic in_cksum implementation is missing in_cksum_split so currently
  cannot be used.

== FreeBSD Source

You should be able to rely on FreebSD manual pages and documentation
for details on the code itself.

=== Automatically Generated FreeBSD Files

The FreeBSD source tarball includes a file named Makefile.rtems which
has stanzas to automatically generate some files.

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kobj&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+9.0-RELEASE&arch=default&format=html

=== Rules for Modifying FreeBSD Source

* Only add lines.  Subtract code by added "ifndef __rtems__". This makes
merging easier in the future.

== libbsd Source

=== What is in git

The git source is a self-contained kit with FreeBSD and RTEMS components
pre-merged. The Makefile in this kit is automatically generated.

Any changes to sources in the freebsd or contrib directories will need to
be merged upstream into our master FreeBSD svn checkout.

=== Building git

You need to configure RTEMS for the desired BSP and install it. Then edit
the file config.inc to set RTEMS_MAKEFILE_PATH appropriately.

----
make
make install
make -C testsuite

At this point, we expect multiple linker errors. That is what we are
currently working on.

=== Organization

The top level directory contains a few directories and files. The following
are important to understand:

* freebsd-to-rtems.py - script to convert to and free FreeBSD and RTEMS trees
* Makefile - automatically generated
* contrib/ - from FreeBSD by script.
* freebsd/ - from FreeBSD by script.
* rtemsbsd/ - RTEMS specific implementations of FreeBSD kernel support routines.
* testsuite/ - RTEMS specific tests
* libbsd.txt - Documentation in Asciidoc

== Moving Code Between FreeBSD SVN and RTEMS libbsd

The script freebsd-to-rtems.py is used to copy code from FreeBSD to the
RTEMS libbsd tree and to reverse this process. This script attempts to
automate this process as much as possible and performs some transformations
on the FreeBSD code. Its command line arguments are shown below:

[listing]
----
freebsd-to-rtems.py [args]
  -?|-h|--help     print this and exit
  -d|--dry-run     run program but no modifications
  -e|--early-exit  evaluate arguments, print results, and exit
  -m|--makefile    just generate Makefile
  -R|--reverse     default FreeBSD -> RTEMS, reverse that
  -r|--rtems       RTEMS directory
  -f|--freebsd     FreeBSD directory
  -v|--verbose     enable verbose output mode
----

In its default mode of operation, freebsd-to-rtems.py is used to copy code
from FreeBSD to the RTEMS libbsd tree and perform transformations.  In forward
mode, the script may be requested to just generate the Makefile.

In "reverse mode", this script undoes those transformations and copies 
the source code back to the FreeBSD SVN tree. This allows us to do 
'svn diff', evaluate changes made by the RTEMS Project, and report changes
back to FreeBSD upstream.

In either mode, the script may be asked to perform a dry-run or be verbose.
Also, in either mode, the script is also smart enough to avoid copying over
files which have not changed. This means that the timestamps of files are
not changed unless the contents change. The script will also report the
number of files which changed. In verbose mode, the script will print
the name of the files which are changed.

The following is an example forward run with no changes.
