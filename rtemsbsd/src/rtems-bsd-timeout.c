 *	It tracks the global 'ticks' but in a way that the individual
 *	threads should not worry about races in the order in which
 *	hardclock() and hardclock_cpu() run on the various CPUs.
 *	cc_softclock is advanced in callout_cpu() to point to the
 *	first entry in cc_callwheel that may need handling. In turn,
 *	a softclock() is scheduled so it can serve the various entries i
 *	such that cc_softclock <= i <= cc_ticks .
 *	XXX maybe cc_softclock and cc_ticks should be volatile ?
 *
 *	cc_ticks is also used in callout_reset_cpu() to determine
 *	when the callout should be served.
