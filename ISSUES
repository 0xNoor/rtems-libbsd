This file contains notes on various known outstanding issues.

+ Sebastian Huber: mentioned some simple test code which would verify
  that the BSD code/and or USB stack was initialized.  That needs to be
  obtained and merged.

+ Sebastian Huber: Since you all developed the USB stack port, we need
  at least a basic functionality test for that on qemu pc.

+ How to initialize TCP/IP stack?

+ linker section issues: I have undefined symbols for
  _bsd__start_set_sysinit_set and _bsd__stop_set_sysinit_set. I added this:
  to my linkcmds.  Is this the only type of new section magic?

    /* sysinit section? */
    . = ALIGN (16);
    _bsd__start_set_sysinit_set = .;
    *(set_sys_init_*);
    _bsd__stop_set_sysinit_set = .;

  What about the old sysctl_set?

+ rtems-bsd-init-with-irq.c:
  rtems_bsd_initialize_with_interrupt_server() has reference to 
    rtems_interrupt_server_initialize() and this method is unimplemented
    - XXX BSP implements pieces
    - BSPs using this software stack must support it apparently.
    - What about Simple Vectored architectures?

+ maxproc variable referenced by rtems-bsd-resource.c.
  - What should it be set to?

+ ngroups_max variable referenced by rtems-bsd-prot.c.
  - What should it be set to?
