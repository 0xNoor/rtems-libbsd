+ Update freebsd-to-rtems.py to:
  - Makefile: add include config.inc
  - Generate config.inc
  - Remove internal setting of $PATH to include gcc-4.5.2/bin
  - Fix line with "install for loop" wraps
  - Do include include target.cfg

+ Add the following (or similar) to the linkcmds any BSP used for testing:

    /* sysinit section? */
    . = ALIGN (16);
    _bsd__start_set_sysinit_set = .;
    *(set_sys_init_*);
    _bsd__stop_set_sysinit_set = .;

  It is unclear what to do about the older sysctl sections or how to ensure
  these are initialized.
